#### Description:

The purpose of this web application is to offer the user an easier way to discover the most requested skills that different job position require.

Since I started looking for work in the tech industry, I have had a hard time keeping up with the skills required across different career paths.


While the Internet is full of resources and information, it can still be somewhat challenging to understand what skills and framework you need to learn to create a more attractive resume for a desired position.

I started this project as a simple CLI tool with python to browse Indeed.com and Indeed.it to get job descriptions using beautiful soup and count all matching keywords for the most popular coding languages, frameworks and platforms in use.


Upon confirming that the script was functional and stable I decided it would be a more useful tool and accessible to a wider audience as a web application, where I also implemented the ability to add custom keywords to the list, so that users can also search for jobs in outside the tech filed.

My only source of data at the moment is Indeed US and Indeed ITA, however in the future I plan on supporting additional job search engines like LinkedIn, Monster Jobs etc.

My plan is to publish this web application on a hosting platform in the hope that it will be a useful resource for anyone looking for a new career
